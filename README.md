# Customer Segmentation for Subscription Service

ðŸ“Š **Power BI** | ðŸ“ˆ **Excel** | ðŸ’¾ **SQL**

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer data from a subscription service to identify segments, track subscription types, and analyze trends in cancellations and renewals. The objective is to create a Power BI dashboard that presents key customer insights, allowing for interactive analysis of customer behavior.

## Objectives
1. **Excel**: Explore subscription patterns and calculate metrics using pivot tables.
2. **SQL**: Write queries to derive insights from customer data.
3. **Power BI**: Build an interactive dashboard to visualize and interpret findings.



## Instructions

### 1. Excel Analysis
Using Excel, we examined subscription data and generated various reports:
   - **Pivot Table - Subscription by Type**: Shows popular subscription types.
   - **Average Subscription Duration**: Calculates the average length of subscriptions.
   - **Cancellation Trends**: Analyzes patterns in subscription cancellations over time.

### 2. SQL Analysis
Load the dataset into SQL Server and execute the following queries to gain insights:
- **Total Customers by Region**: Counts customers across different regions.
- **Most Popular Subscription Type**: Identifies the most subscribed service.
- **Early Cancellations**: Finds customers who canceled within the first 6 months.
- **Average Subscription Duration**: Calculates the average duration across all customers.
- **Long-Term Subscribers**: Lists customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
- **Revenue by Subscription Type**: Summarizes revenue by each subscription category.
- **Top Regions by Cancellations**: Lists regions with the highest cancellation rates.
- **Active vs. Canceled Subscriptions**: Counts total active and canceled subscriptions.



### 3. Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard visualizes customer segmentation and subscription trends:

- **Customer Segmentation**: Displays distribution by subscription type, region, and duration.
- **Cancellations and Renewals**: Highlights trends in cancellations and renewal rates.
- **Subscription Trends**: Includes slicers for interactive filtering by type, region, and duration.
